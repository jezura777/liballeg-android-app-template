Should be enough to just clone and open in Android Studio.

Tested on Android 11.

Please change `Android > namespace` and `Android > defaultConfig > applicationId` in Project view `liballeg/app/build.gradle` to `org.{your organization}.app.{application name}` or to anything you want it doesen't really matter.
